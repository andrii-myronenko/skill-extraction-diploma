We’re looking for a Senior Back-End Engineer to join us and help make it happen . <ORGANIZATION> platform helps customers understand their financial data and make better financial decisions . We collate and crunch different streams of data for each customer ( e.g . credit history scores eligibility results from lenders ) to give them a meaningful credit profile and match them to financial & home products that work for them . We’ve won several awards for our product innovation in the last few years and more importantly we have consistently been highest rated in our category on TrustPilot . At <ORGANIZATION> we believe in ‘maximum autonomy with maximum alignment’ and in a positive bottom-up culture . Though we have a much-loved office near <LOCATION> <LOCATION> we are currently 100% remote and pride ourselves in the supportive and collaborative environment we have created over the last year . We have a culture that values work-life balance employee wellbeing and interpersonal connections and we’re looking forward to reopening our <LOCATION> <LOCATION> office as soon as we’re able although we will remain completely flexible . What’s the job? As a Senior Back-End Engineer at <ORGANIZATION> you’ll get to work on real products being used by real customers ( over 3 million of them) . You'll be given problems you can get stuck into . You'll use modern workflows and tooling . Our staff surveys show that we're committed to giving all employees autonomy so you can expect the freedom to prioritise your work . You'll be encouraged to maintain quality and be pushed past your own expectations . You'll be exposed to a wide range of tech and won't be restricted to a Back End-only role . You'll be working alongside frontend developers using React and the latest JavaScript frameworks . You'll also get the opportunity to work with AWS infrastructure and get to grips with producing cloud native software . Our principles We hold some key principles that guide us on our path to excellence . We believe in continuous integration and automated testing . We believe in domain modelling and ubiquitous language . We believe in logging monitoring and that if you build it you run it . We believe in serverless containerisation and dev/prod environment parity . We believe in experimentation continuous improvement and learning from failure . We believe in #noestimates whiteboarding and great coffee . What’s the stack? We program in a variety of languages in the backend . At the moment it’s C# F# and TypeScript depending on the needs of the project but you don’t need to know or use all of those one or more will do . We’re doing a lot of work using the serverless framework and equally are effusive about functional programming . Generally speaking our front-end apps are written in variations of React . Our workflow is entirely command line driven . Our favourite editor is Visual Studio Code but you're welcome to bring your own! We like to experiment with test frameworks and our current suite includes Cypress Jest Nunit SpecFlow Expecto FsCheck & Canopy . Our build pipeline is scripted with bash and executed using CircleCI . We take advantage of cloud services provided by AWS including but not limited to functions as a service hosting messaging relational and non-relational databases . We rely on Loggly to trace application behaviour and often to log business metrics . Whilst it might sound like we have all bases covered we've got plenty to improve upon which is why we need you . What’s the environment? We operate in small cross-functional teams usually comprising engineers designers UX people and a product manager . We loosely follow Agile processes with boards stand-ups and stories etc. however we tend to release continually as opposed to in sprints . We follow good XP practices like TDD BDD integration testing continuous integration and so on . About you: In-depth knowledge and experience of C# F# and/or Typescript . You’re a problem solver who's curious about new technology . You're aligned with our principles and interested in learning more about functional programming . You're aware of the 12-Factor App approach and want to build cloud - native systems . You're someone who takes ownership and who tries to learn as much as possible . You're both a good listener and able to explain concepts to others . You're committed to improving yourself . You're able to demonstrate interest in technologies that are beyond the scope of your daily workflow . You're lazy you don't like boring repetitive tasks and you like to outsource your labour to the compiler . You won't be expected to have deep knowledge of our stack but you will be expected to help us make forward strides by applying yourself to learning . Above all you’re a pragmatist who’s willing to challenge us as well as yourself .
